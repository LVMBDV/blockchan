# Blockchan

Blockchan is a decentralized anonymous imageboard that utilizes a public,
proof-of-work regulated blockchain to store and securely synchronize posts
between many nodes.

Note that this project was for my Bachelor's thesis and the process of preparing
redundant documents and presenting it to a jury of uninterested people made me
absolutely hate the project I started with great ambitions. So this project is
*abandoned*, I'm afraid. Feel free to read through it to feel my misery though.
